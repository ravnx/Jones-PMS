/* --General Information 
 * 
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * --Varibles
 * The following variables may be used in the email subject or body.  Note that
 * all variables begin with the dollar symbol ($), which is known as the variable delimiter.
 * When the email is sent, these variables will be replaced with the relevant information.
 *
 * $COMMENT  - The comment entered when the package was checked in
 * $PKGTIME  - Time at which the package was checked in
 * $PKGID    - Package's package ID
 * $FNAME    - Recipient's first name
 * $LNAME    - Recipient's last name
 * $NETID    - Recipient's net id
 * $NUMPKGS  - Number of packages currently checked in
 * $ALIAS    - The alias (name) of the sender.
 *
 * In order to use the dollar symbol in the e-mail without having it act as a variable delimiter,
 * enter a backslash (\) immediately before the dollar symbol.  This is called 'escaping' the character.
 * For example, consider you want the following to appear as-is in the email:
 *		Makin' Ca$h Money!
 * If we write this in the template, the program will think we want to reference a 
 * variable named "$h" (and will likely complain that it can't find it).  Therefore,
 * we must escape the dollar symbol with a backslash, as below:
 *		Makin' Ca\$h Money!
 * Note that you only need to escape the dollar symbol in the templates below; You do not need
 * to escape them when writing comments when the package is checked in.
 *
 *
 * --HTML
 * Emails support a limited form of HTML, which will be rendered by the E-mail client (Outlook, Thunderbird, Gmail, etc.)
 * when the email is recieved.  HTML is a language used to construct web pages, and therefore you can make
 * your email look a lot like a web page if you want to do so.  HTML is a large and somewhat complicated language, so we'll 
 * only talk about the most basic parts here.  You do not need to use it at all if you don't want to; simply writing plain text 
 * below will work fine. 
 *
 * You can make a portion of the text bold, emphasized, or underlined by surrounding it with the <b></b>, <em></em>, or <u></u> 
 * tags, respectively.  For example, if we want to have the "as soon as possible" portion bolded in the text below:
 * 		Please pick up your packages as soon as possible!
 * We would write:
 * 		Please pick up your packages <b>as soon as possible</b>!
 *
 * We can combine and nest these tags however we like, for example:
 * 		<em>Please</em> <b><u>pick up</u></b> your packages <b>as soon as possible</b>!
 * Which would have "Please" emphasized, "pick up" in bold and underlined, and "as soon as possible" in bold.
 *
 * HTML can do a lot of other cool stuff, but there is way too much to cover here.  If you're interested in learning more,
 * a good place to start is http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp
 *
 * Note that, unlike standard HTML, line breaks below will appear in the email (this is done by replacing all newlines with
 * <br> tags).  This is to make what you see below closer to what the Email will look like.  To turn this feature off, 
 * replace the 'TRUE' under "AUTO-LINEBREAK:" with 'FALSE'.  Unless you understand the consequences of doing so, you probably
 * do not want to change this option.
